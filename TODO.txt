- pytsv_csv_to_tsv does not work well because the csvreader that it
	uses uses 'ascii' instead of 'utf-8'. fix this.
- TsvReader does not have a "header=True" property that I can pass
	at construction that can be used to skip the first line.
- move this whole package to use pytconf instead of click.
	as part of this unify all utils to one executable.
- move this package to pydmt.
- do progress report for most of the utilities here.
    measure the size of the file using a function and do progress.
    allow to turn off this behaviour.
- write python app to check multiple tsv files in parallel.
	add it to pytsv.
	have an option for it to leave a stamp for files which are correct.
- better naming convention for all of the scripts in this package.
    Gather them into groups.
- add ability to do concatenation of tsv files according to key
- add tsv writer that knows how to write by column names.
    It may even emit a "# column1 column2 ..." header if the user wants.
- add the option in csv_to_tsv and tsv_to_csv to have filtering (for instance
	encoding, removing of special characters and so forth).
